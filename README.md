# Wind Tunnel User Interface Program
This Github contains the code for LCD/Keypad interface for the Wind Tunnel.
The idea is that the user should be able to control the operation of the tunnel without
the need for a computer connection to the Teknic ClearPath MCPV motor. 
To see how to wire the motor using the molex cable, as well as all other necessary setup/connections
refer to the motor's manual found below:
